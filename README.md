# WordCreationPuzzle
## Assumptions
1.  The only way to build bigger words was to start with the smallest valid word and then add letters.  
  1a.  If the smallest word was only one letter that wasn't in other words in the list the largest list would be just that word. {c} for {c, ab, bbb, bbbb}

2. The smallest word shouldn't appear in a new word more than once.  For example if the shortest word was "a", "bab" would be okay but not "baba".
